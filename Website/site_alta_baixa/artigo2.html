            <p>Type Design is a domain that multiple times has profited from<br>
               the emergence of new tools and technologies. The transforma-<br>
               tion of type from physical to digital, the dissemination of font<br>
                design software and the adoption of web typography make type<br>
                design better known and more accessible. This domain has recei-<br>
                ved an even greater push with the increasing adoption of genera-<br>
                tive tools to create more diverse and experimental fonts. Nowa-<br>
                days, with the application of Machine Learning to various doma-<br>
                ins, typography has also been influenced by it. In this work, we<br>
                produce a dataset by extracting letter skeletons from a collection<br>
                of existing fonts. Then we trained a Variational Autoencoder and a<br>
                Sketch Decoder to learn to create these skeletons that can be used<br>
                to generate new ones by exploring the latent space. This process<br>
                also allows us to control the style of the resulting skeletons and <br>
                interpolate between different characters. Finally, we developed<br>
                new glyphs by filling the generated skeletons based on the original<br>
                letters’ stroke width and showing some applications of the results. </p>

              <p>The design of type has undergone numerous changes over time.<br>
                In the early years, typography was seen as a system made up of a<br>
                series of rules. The artistic movements that arrived at the begin-<br>
                ning of the twentieth century rejected the historical forms and trans-<br>
                formed outdated aspects of visual language and expression. Howe-<br>
                ver, projects that combined software, arts and design only appeared<br>
                a few years later with the proliferation of personal computers, allow-<br>
                ing programming to reach a wider audience. Thanks to all these chan-<br>
                ges, the tools to design type changed, and new possibilities for typo-<br>
                graphic experimentation appeared, resulting in (i) grammar-based tech-<br>
                niques that explore the principle of database amplification; (ii) evoluti-<br>
                onary systems that breed design solutions under the direction of a <br>
                designer; (iii) or even, Machine Learning (ML) systems that learn the<br>
                glyphs features to build new ones. These computational approaches <br>
                can also be helpful as a starting point of inspiration.<br><br>
                Most emerging fonts continue to be developed by type designers who <br>
                study the shape of each letter and its design with great precision, des-<br>
                pite the emergence of these new possibilities. Type design is a hugely <br>
                complex discipline, and its expertise ensures typography quality. <br>
                Moreover, with the proliferation of web typography and online reading,<br>
                the use of variable and dynamic fonts has increased, allowing more opti-<br>
                ons for font designers and font users. Additionally, visual identities crea-<br>
                ted nowadays are becoming more dynamic. Museums, institutions, organi-<br>
                zations, events and media increasingly rely on this type of identity.

          </div>
          <div class="container2-text">
            <p>Consequently, designers should adapt their work to these new possibilities<br>
              by creating dynamic identities with animations and mutations. Even though<br>
              new computer systems create expressive and out-of-the-box results, they do <br>
              not have the knowledge of an expert. But this is also an advantage, allowing<br>
              non-arbitrary exploitation that extends the range of possibilities. It is neces-<br>
              sary to create a balance to take advantage of the computational systems and<br>
              the expert labour. Moreover, most generative systems that design type focus<br>
              on the letters’ filling and don’t see the structure of a glyph as a variation parameter.<br><br>
              To overcome these limitations, we propose an Autoregressive model that creates<br>
              new glyph skeletons by the interpolation of existing ones. Our skeleton-based<br>
              approach uses glyphs skeletons of existing fonts as input to ensure the quality of <br>
              the generated results.

          <div class="container3-text">
            <p>The division of the structure and the filling of the glyphs add variability to the<br>
              results. Different glyphs can be created by just changing the structure or the <br>
              filling. The proposed approach enables the exploration of a continuous range <br>
              of font styles by navigating on the Autoencoder (AE) learnt latent space. With<br>
              the results of this approach, it is also possible to apply different filling methods<br>
              that use the stroke width of the original letters to produce new glyphs.<br><br>

              The remainder of this paper is divided into three sections. The following section,<br>
              Related Work, analyzes related projects in the domain of computational typogra-<br>
              phy with Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). The second section, Approach, descri-<br>
              bes the construction of the used dataset and explains the training process. Then, <br>
              in the Results section, we present and discuss the different experimentations per-<br>
              formed and the obtained results. In this section, we also present a set of different<br>
              possible applications of the outputs of our system. In the final section, Conclusion<br>
              and Discussion, we draw some conclusions and lay out future work.

            <p>Over time, the methods and technologies available for type design<br>
              have improved and designers have to evolve and adapt their process <br>
              of thinking in accordance. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)<br>
              have revealed impressive advances, presenting high-resolution images<br>
              nearly indistinguishable from the real ones. In the typographic field,<br>
              they are helpful when one wishes to obtain coherent glyphs in a typeface.<br>
              When designing a typeface, one has to simultaneously seek an aesthetically<br>
              appealing result and coherence among the different glyphs. This can be <br>
              facilitated by exploring the similarities between the same letter present<br>
              across diverse fonts, and the transferred stylistic elements within the same<br>
              font. Balashova et al. develop a stroke-based geometric model for glyphs, a<br>
              fitting procedure to re-parametrise arbitrary fonts to capture these correla-<br>
              tions. The framework uses a manifold learning technique that allows for<br>
              interactively improving the fit quality and interpolating, adding or removing<br>
              stylistic elements in existing fonts. Campbell and Kautz develop a similar<br>
              contour-based framework allowing the editing of a glyph and the propaga-<br>
              tion of stylistic elements across the entire alphabet. Phan et al. and <br>
              Suveeranont and Igarashi present two different frameworks that give one <br>
              or more outline-based glyphs of several characters as input, producing a <br>
              complete typeface that bears a similar style to the inputs. Rehling and <br>
              Hofstadter use one or more grid-based lowercase letters to generate the<br>
              rest of the Roman alphabet, creating glyphs that share different style features.<br><br> 

              Azadi et al. develop an end-to-end stacked conditional GAN model to generate<br>
              a set of highly-stylised glyph images following a consistent style from very few examples.
             </p>
          </div>
          <div class="text-containerrelatedwork1">
            <p>We can also imitate the behaviour of a variable font using Recurrent<br>
              Neural Networks (RNNs) and interpolate to obtain intermediate results.<br>
              Lopes et al. model the drawing process of fonts by building sequential<br>
              generative models of vector graphics. Their model provides a scale-<br>
              invariant representation of imagery. The latent representation may be<br>
               systematically exploited to achieve style propagation. Shamir and <br>
               Rappoport present a parametric feature-based font design approach. <br>
               The development of a visual design system and the use of constraints <br>
               for preserving the designer’s intentions create a more natural environ-<br>
               ment in which high-level parametric behaviours can be defined. By <br>
               changing the glyph parameters they create several family instances.<br><br>  

              Also, outside the typographic field, there are some good examples<br>
              exploring the latent space. Sketch-RNN is an RNN able to construct<br>
              stroke-based drawings. The network produces sketches of common <br>
              objects in a vector format and explores the latent space interpolation<br>
              of various vector images. There is also increased attention to these <br>
              networks and their application to facilitate the use and combination <br>
              of fonts. A usual way to combine different fonts is by using fonts from<br>
              the same family or created by the same designer. Another way is to<br>
              find fonts that match x-height and ascenders/descenders. Fontjoy is<br>
              another tool to facilitate the process of mixing and matching typefaces <br>
              and choosing fonts to use side by side. FontMap and Font-VAE are tools<br>
              developed with the goal of discovering alternative fonts with the<br>
               same aesthetics.
