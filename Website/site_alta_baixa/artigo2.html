            <p>Type Design is a domain that multiple times has profited from
               the emergence of new tools and technologies. The transformation of type from physical to digital, the dissemination of font
                design software and the adoption of web typography make type
                design better known and more accessible. This domain has received an even greater push with the increasing adoption of generative tools to create more diverse and experimental fonts. Nowadays, with the application of Machine Learning to various domains, typography has also been influenced by it. In this work, we produce a dataset by extracting letter skeletons from a collection<br>
                of existing fonts. Then we trained a Variational Autoencoder and a
                Sketch Decoder to learn to create these skeletons that can be used
                to generate new ones by exploring the latent space. This process
                also allows us to control the style of the resulting skeletons and 
                interpolate between different characters. Finally, we developed
                new glyphs by filling the generated skeletons based on the original
                letters’ stroke width and showing some applications of the results. </p>

              <p>The design of type has undergone numerous changes over time.
                In the early years, typography was seen as a system made up of a
                series of rules. The artistic movements that arrived at the begin
                ning of the twentieth century rejected the historical forms and transformed outdated aspects of visual language and expression. However, projects that combined software, arts and design only appeared
                a few years later with the proliferation of personal computers, allowing programming to reach a wider audience. Thanks to all these changes, the tools to design type changed, and new possibilities for typographic experimentation appeared, resulting in (i) grammar-based techniques that explore the principle of database amplification; (ii) evolutionary systems that breed design solutions under the direction of a 
                designer; (iii) or even, Machine Learning (ML) systems that learn the
                glyphs features to build new ones. These computational approaches 
                can also be helpful as a starting point of inspiration.<br><br>
                Most emerging fonts continue to be developed by type designers who 
                study the shape of each letter and its design with great precision, despite the emergence of these new possibilities. Type design is a hugely 
                complex discipline, and its expertise ensures typography quality.
                Moreover, with the proliferation of web typography and online reading,
                the use of variable and dynamic fonts has increased, allowing more options for font designers and font users. Additionally, visual identities created nowadays are becoming more dynamic. Museums, institutions, organizations, events and media increasingly rely on this type of identity. 
                 </p>

          </div>
          <div class="container2-text">
            <p>Consequently, designers should adapt their work to these new possibilities
              by creating dynamic identities with animations and mutations. Even though
              new computer systems create expressive and out-of-the-box results, they do 
              not have the knowledge of an expert. But this is also an advantage, allowing
              non-arbitrary exploitation that extends the range of possibilities. It is necessary to create a balance to take advantage of the computational systems and
              the expert labour. Moreover, most generative systems that design type focus
              on the letters’ filling and don’t see the structure of a glyph as a variation parameter.<br><br>
              To overcome these limitations, we propose an Autoregressive model that creates
              new glyph skeletons by the interpolation of existing ones. Our skeleton-based
              approach uses glyphs skeletons of existing fonts as input to ensure the quality of 
              the generated results.

            <p>The division of the structure and the filling of the glyphs add variability to the
              results. Different glyphs can be created by just changing the structure or the 
              filling. The proposed approach enables the exploration of a continuous range 
              of font styles by navigating on the Autoencoder (AE) learnt latent space. With
              the results of this approach, it is also possible to apply different filling methods
              that use the stroke width of the original letters to produce new glyphs.<br><br>

              The remainder of this paper is divided into three sections. The following section,
              Related Work, analyzes related projects in the domain of computational typogra
              phy with Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). The second section, Approach, describes the construction of the used dataset and explains the training process. Then, 
              in the Results section, we present and discuss the different experimentations performed and the obtained results. In this section, we also present a set of different
              possible applications of the outputs of our system. In the final section, Conclusion
              and Discussion, we draw some conclusions and lay out future work.

            <p>Over time, the methods and technologies available for type design
              have improved and designers have to evolve and adapt their process 
              of thinking in accordance. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
              have revealed impressive advances, presenting high-resolution images
              nearly indistinguishable from the real ones. In the typographic field,
              they are helpful when one wishes to obtain coherent glyphs in a typeface.
              When designing a typeface, one has to simultaneously seek an aesthetically
              appealing result and coherence among the different glyphs. This can be 
              facilitated by exploring the similarities between the same letter present
              across diverse fonts, and the transferred stylistic elements within the same
              font. Balashova et al. develop a stroke-based geometric model for glyphs, a
              fitting procedure to re-parametrise arbitrary fonts to capture these correlations. The framework uses a manifold learning technique that allows for
              interactively improving the fit quality and interpolating, adding or removing
              stylistic elements in existing fonts. Campbell and Kautz develop a similar
              contour-based framework allowing the editing of a glyph and the propagation of stylistic elements across the entire alphabet. Phan et al. and 
              Suveeranont and Igarashi present two different frameworks that give one 
              or more outline-based glyphs of several characters as input, producing a 
              complete typeface that bears a similar style to the inputs. Rehling and 
              Hofstadter use one or more grid-based lowercase letters to generate the
              rest of the Roman alphabet, creating glyphs that share different style features.<br>

          </div>
          <div class="text-containerrelatedwork1">
            <p>We can also imitate the behaviour of a variable font using Recurrent
              Neural Networks (RNNs) and interpolate to obtain intermediate results.
              Lopes et al. model the drawing process of fonts by building sequential
              generative models of vector graphics. Their model provides a scale
              invariant representation of imagery. The latent representation may be
               systematically exploited to achieve style propagation. Shamir and 
               Rappoport present a parametric feature-based font design approach. 
               The development of a visual design system and the use of constraints 
               for preserving the designer’s intentions create a more natural environment in which high-level parametric behaviours can be defined. By 
               changing the glyph parameters they create several family instances.  

              Also, outside the typographic field, there are some good examples
              exploring the latent space. Sketch-RNN is an RNN able to construction
              stroke-based drawings. The network produces sketches of common 
              objects in a vector format and explores the latent space interpolation
              of various vector images. There is also increased attention to these 
              networks and their application to facilitate the use and combination 
              of fonts. A usual way to combine different fonts is by using fonts from
              the same family or created by the same designer. Another way is to
              find fonts that match x-height and ascenders/descenders. Fontjoy is
              another tool to facilitate the process of mixing and matching typefaces 
              and choosing fonts to use side by side. FontMap and Font-VAE are tools
              developed with the goal of discovering alternative fonts with the
               same aesthetics.
