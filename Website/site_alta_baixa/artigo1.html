                Princeton Architectural Press is about to publish a collection 
                of essays I've written, many of which first appeared here on 
                Design Observer. I wanted it to feel like a real book for readers — 
                it has no pictures — so I asked Abbott to design it. He suggested we set 
                each one of the 79 pieces in a different typeface. I loved this idea, 
                but wasn't sure how far he'd

                I asked him. "Would we set it in ITC Garamond?" He looked at me as if I was crazy. "Of course," he said.
                The book is beautiful, by the way, and not the least bit slutty.

                Sometimes I think that Massimo Vignelli may be using too many 
                typefaces, not too few. A true fundamentalist requires a monotheistic 
                worldview: one world, one typeface. The designers at Experimental 
                Jetset have made the case for Helvetica. My partner Abbott Miller

                About 10 years ago, I was asked to redesign the logo for New York 
                magazine. Milton Glaser had based the logo on Bookman Swash Italic, 
                a typeface I found unimaginably dated and ugly. But Glaser's logo had 
                replaced an earlier one by Peter Palazzo that was based on Caslon Italic.

                I proposed we return to Caslon, and distinctly remember saying,

                I saw something in the office that really caught my eye. It was set 
                in Bookman Swash Italic, and it looked great. Ugly, but great.

                requirements, but was one of the few I know that was designed by an architect, 
                Bertram Goodhue. Recently, I designed a publications program for a

                the public would be completely unaware of the story behind the font selection,

                I've heard of several projects where the designer found a font that was 
                created the same year the client's organization was founded. This must give the 
                recommendation an aura of manifest destiny that is positively irresistible. I haven't 
                had that luck yet, but still try to find the same kind of evocative alignment.

                For instance, I was never a fan of Aldo Novarese's Eurostyle, but I came to love 
                it while working on a monograph on Eero Saarinen: they both share an expressiveness 
                peculiar to the postwar optimism of the 1950's.

                Some typefaces are just perfect for certain things. 
                I've specified exotic fonts for identity programs that 
                work beautifully in headlines and even in text, but sooner or later 
                you have to set that really tiny type at the bottom of the business reply 
                card. This is what Franklin Gothic is for.

                Careful, though: some typefaces work too well. Frutiger has been used so much 
                for signage programs in hospitals and airports that seeing it now makes me feel 
                that I'm about to get diagnosed with a brain tumor or miss the 7:00 to O'Hare.

                Then, after a decade, I left my first job. Suddenly I could use 
                any typeface I wanted, and I went nuts. On one of my first projects, 
                I used 37 different fonts on 16 pages. My wife, who had attended Catholic 
                school herself, found this all too familiar. She remembered classmates 
                who had switched to public school after eight years under the nuns: freed 
                at last from demure plaid uniforms, they wore the shortest skirts they could 
                find. "Jesus," she said, looking at one of my multiple font demolition derbies. 
                "You've become a real slut, haven't you?"

                It was true. Liberated from monogamy, I became typographically promiscuous. 
                I have since, I think, learned to modulate my behavior — like any substance 
                abuser, I learned that binges are time-consuming, costly, and ultimately 
                counterproductive — but I've never gone back to five-typeface sobriety. Those 
                thousands of typefaces are still out there, but my recovery has required that 
                I become more discriminating and come up with some answers to this seemingly 
                simple question: why choose a particular typeface? Here are thirteen reasons.

                For the first ten years of my career, I worked for Massimo Vignelli, 
                a designer who is legendary for using a very limited number of typefaces. 
                Between 1980 and 1990, most of my projects were set in five fonts: Helvetica 
                (naturally), Futura, Garamond No. 3, Century Expanded, and, of course, Bodoni.
                For Massimo, this was an ideological choice, an ethical imperative. 
                "In the new computer age," he once wrote, "the proliferation of typefaces and 
                type manipulations represents a new level of visual pollution threatening our culture. </div>
              <div class="intro intro-col2">Out of thousands of typefaces, all we need are a few basic ones, 
                and trash the rest.” For me, it became a time-saving device. Why spend hours choosing 
                between Bembo, Sabon and Garamond No. 3 every time you needed a Venetian Roman? 
                For most people — my mom, for instance — these were distinctions without differences. 
                Why not just commit to Garamond No. 3 and never think about it again? My Catholic school 
                education must have well prepared me for this kind of moral clarity. I accepted it gratefully.</div>
